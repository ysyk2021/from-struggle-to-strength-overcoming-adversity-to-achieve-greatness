In order to overcome adversity and achieve greatness, it is essential to identify your sources of strength. These sources can come from within yourself, as well as from external factors such as your support system and personal relationships. In this chapter, we will discuss some strategies for identifying your sources of strength.

Reflect on past experiences
---------------------------

One way to identify your sources of strength is to reflect on past experiences where you have overcome adversity. Consider the challenges you faced, how you overcame them, and what strengths you utilized in the process.

Reflecting on these experiences can help you identify your personal strengths, as well as the people and resources that supported you during difficult times.

Take a personality assessment
-----------------------------

Taking a personality assessment can also be helpful in identifying your sources of strength. Assessments like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or the StrengthsFinder can provide insights into your natural strengths and abilities.

These assessments can help you better understand your personality, values, and motivations, which can inform your approach to overcoming adversity and achieving greatness.

Seek feedback from others
-------------------------

Seeking feedback from others is another effective way to identify your sources of strength. Ask colleagues, friends, and family members what they see as your strengths and abilities.

This outside perspective can provide valuable insights into your strengths and how you can leverage them to overcome challenges and achieve your goals.

Explore new opportunities
-------------------------

Exploring new opportunities can also help you identify your sources of strength. Trying new things and pushing outside of your comfort zone can reveal hidden talents and abilities.

Engage in activities that challenge you and allow you to utilize your strengths. This can help build your confidence and resilience in the face of adversity.

Conclusion
----------

Identifying your sources of strength is essential to overcoming adversity and achieving greatness. By reflecting on past experiences, taking personality assessments, seeking feedback from others, and exploring new opportunities, you can better understand your strengths and abilities. This self-awareness can help you leverage your sources of strength to overcome challenges and achieve your goals. Remember to regularly reflect on your sources of strength and use them to build your resilience and success over time.
