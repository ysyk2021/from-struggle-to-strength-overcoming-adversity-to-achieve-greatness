This may involve reaching out to friends, family, or colleagues for emotional support, or seeking out mentorship or coaching to help develop new skills and perspectives. By building a strong support network, we can overcome adversity and maintain our resilience over time.

Practicing Self-Care

Practicing self-care is another essential aspect of building resilience. This may involve getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and engaging in activities that bring us joy and relaxation. By taking care of ourselves physically and emotionally, we can build the strength and energy needed to overcome adversity and achieve greatness.
